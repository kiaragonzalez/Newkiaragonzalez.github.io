        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! Iâ€™m Kiara Gonzalez and I work  part-time sales associate at Old Navy! Through my five months working there I have gained valuable experience in customer service, and teamwork, all while working in a fast-paced job. This role has allowed me to understand all the details of running a retail shop. 
At Old Navy, I serve to give every customer the best shopping experience. My primary responsibilities include assisting customers on the sales floor and handling the registers. Whether helping a customer find the perfect outfit or answering questions about promotions and sales, I pride myself in providing an excellent service that aligns with Old Navyâ€™s commitment to delivering quality. 
One of best things of my role at Old Navy offers is engaging with customers. I take the time to listen to their needs and give them personalized recommendations, which builds rapport. I enjoy helping customers feel confident and excited and I strive to create a welcoming atmosphere in the store.. The idea of Old Navy is to be inclusive to all, which is something I love to offer to all the customers which walk through those doors. 

In addition to customer service, I am also responsible for maintaining the visual appeal of the store. This includes organizing merchandise, ensuring that the store is clean and orderly, and participating in inventory management. The importance of merchandising can not be overstated in retail, as a well-organized store enhances the shopping experience and sales. As a part-time employee, I have learned how to effectively balance my work schedule with other commitments, such as school or personal projects. Time management is a crucial skill in this role, especially when juggling various tasks like customer service, and cashier duties during peak hours. Iâ€™ve also gained experience in working with a diverse team of colleagues, and I understand the importance of collaboration in achieving both individual and team goals. Whether itâ€™s a busy weekend shift or a slower weekday, Iâ€™ve learned how to adapt to different workloads and contribute to the overall success of the store.
Moreover, my role at Old Navy has allowed me to understand the retail business from the ground up. Through training, ongoing feedback, and hands-on experience, Iâ€™ve learned how stores operate on a daily basis, from managing inventory to understanding sales metrics. Old Navyâ€™s focus on creating a positive work environment has helped me feel supported in my growth and development, and I appreciate the opportunities for advancement within the company. My managers constantly tell us new ways to improve and to be at our best performances, I take pride knowing that every piece of feedback is being applied and being worked on slowly. 
Overall, working at Old Navy has been a fulfilling and educational experience. I have not only gained retail and customer service skills but also developed a deeper understanding of the fashion industry, teamwork, and customer loyalty. As a part-time associate, I am proud to be a part of a company that values inclusivity, community, and the importance of delivering great customer experiences.
